Hi!

In order to run scraper.js in node, donut-login.json must be filled with a working set of Caltech
username/password log in credentials. I used my own to get scraped-data.json, but removed it after.


TODO:
  - add pandas to python script for data processing
  - output image from python to html (create new file in directory)
