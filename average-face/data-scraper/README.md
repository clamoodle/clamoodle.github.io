Hi!

Note all results from data scraper are alredy hard coded in scraped-data.json and user-imgs.

In order to run scraper.js in node, donut-login.json must be filled with a valid pair of Caltech username/password log in credentials. I used my own login to get scraped-data.json and all images in the user-imgs folder, but removed it after, obviously.
